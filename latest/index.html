Unlike traditional package managers, which install and manage a single global set of packages, Pkg3 is designed around “environments”: independent sets of packages that can be local to an individual project or shared and selected by name. The exact set of packages and versions in an environment is captured in a <em>manifest file</em> which can be checked into a project repository and tracked in version control, significantly improving reproducibility of projects. If you’ve ever tried to run code you haven’t used in a while only to find that you can’t get anything to work because you’ve updated or uninstalled some of the packages your project was using, you’ll understand the motivation for this approach. In Pkg3, since each project maintains its own independent set of package versions, you’ll never have this problem again. Moreover, if you check out a project on a new system, you can simply materialize the environment described by its manifest file and immediately be up and running with a known-good set of dependencies.</p><p>Since environments are managed and updated independently from each other, “dependency hell” is significantly alleviated in Pkg3. If you want to use the latest and greatest version of some package in a new project but you’re stuck on an older version in a different project, that’s no problem – since they have separate environments they can just use different versions, which are both installed at the same time in different locations on your system. The location of each package version is canonical, so when environments use the same versions of packages, they can share installations, avoiding unnecessary duplication of the package. Old package versions that are no longer used by any environments are periodically “garbage collected” by the package manager.</p><p>Pkg3’s approach to local environments may be familiar to people who have used Python’s <code>virtualenv</code> or Ruby’s <code>bundler</code>. In Julia, instead of hacking the language’s code loading mechanisms to support environments, we have the benefit that Julia natively understands them. In addition, Julia environments are “stackable”: you can overlay one environment with another and thereby have access to additional packages outside of the primary environment. This makes it easy to work on a project, which provides the primary environment, while still having access to all your usual dev tools like profilers, debuggers, and so on, just by having an environment including these dev tools later in the load path.</p><p>Last but not least, Pkg3 is designed to support federated package registries. This means that it allows multiple registries managed by different parties to interact seamlessly. In particular, this includes private registries which can live behind corporate firewalls. You can install and update your own packages from a private registry with exactly the same tools and workflows that you use to install and manage official Julia packages. If you urgently need to apply a hotfix for a public package that’s critical to your company’s product, you can tag a private version of it in your company’s internal registry and get a fix to your developers and ops teams quickly and easily without having to wait for an upstream patch to be accepted and published. Once an official fix is published, however, you can just upgrade your dependencies and you&#39;ll be back on an official release again.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Glossary-1" href="#Glossary-1">Glossary</a></h2><p><strong>Project:</strong> a source tree with a standard layout, including a <code>src</code> directory for the main body of Julia code, a <code>test</code> directory for testing the project, <code>docs</code> for documentation files, and optionally a <code>build</code> directory for a build script and its outputs. A project will typically also have a project file and may optionally have a manifest file:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Project file:</strong> a file in the root directory of a project, named <code>Project.toml</code> (or <code>JuliaProject.toml</code>) describing metadata about the project, including its name, UUID (for packages), authors, license, and the names and UUIDs of packages and libraries that it depends on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Manifest file:</strong> a file in the root directory of a project, named <code>Manifest.toml</code> (or <code>JuliaManifest.toml</code>) describing a complete dependency graph and exact versions of each package and library used by a project.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Package:</strong> a project which provides reusable functionality that can be used by other Julia projects via <code>import X</code> or <code>using X</code>. A package should have a project file with a <code>uuid</code> entry giving its package UUID. This UUID is used to identify the package in projects that depend on it.</p><div class="admonition note"><div class="admonition-title">Note</div><div class="admonition-text"><p>For legacy reasons it is possible to load a package without a project file or UUID from the REPL or the top-level of a script. It is not possible, however, to load a package with a project file or UUID from a project with them. Once you&#39;ve loaded from a project file, everything needs a project file and UUID.</p></div></div><p><strong>Application:</strong> a project which provides standalone functionality not intended to be reused by other Julia projects. For example a web application or a commmand-line utility. An application may have a UUID but does not need one. An application may also provide global configuration options for packages it depends on. Packages, on the other hand, may not provide global configuration since that could conflict with the configuration of the main application.</p><div class="admonition note"><div class="admonition-title">Note</div><div class="admonition-text"><p><strong>Projects <em>vs.</em> Packages <em>vs.</em> Applications:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Project is an umbrella term: packages and applications are kinds of projects.</p></li><li><p>Packages should have UUIDs, applications can have a UUIDs but don&#39;t need them.</p></li><li><p>Applications can provide global configuration, whereas packages cannot.</p></li></ol></div></div><p><strong>Library (future work):</strong> a compiled binary dependency (not written in Julia) packaged to be used by a Julia project. These are currently typically built in- place by a <code>deps/build.jl</code> script in a project’s source tree, but in the future we plan to make libraries first-class entities directly installed and upgraded by the package manager.</p><p><strong>Environment:</strong> the combination of the top-level name map provided by a project file combined with the dependency graph and map from packages to their entry points provided by a manifest file. For more detail see the manual section on code loading.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Explicit environment:</strong> an environment in the form of an explicit project file and an optional corresponding manifest file together in a directory. If the manifest file is absent then the implied dependency graph and location maps are empty.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implicit environment:</strong> an environment provided as a directory (without a project file or manifest file) containing packages with entry points of the form <code>X.jl</code>, <code>X.jl/src/X.jl</code> or <code>X/src/X.jl</code>. The top-level name map is implied by these entry points. The dependency graph is implied by the existence of project files inside of these package directories, e.g. <code>X.jl/Project.toml</code> or <code>X/Project.toml</code>. The dependencies of the <code>X</code> package are the dependencies in the corresponding project file if there is one. The location map is implied by the entry points themselves.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Registry:</strong> a source tree with a standard layout recording metadata about a registered set of packages, the tagged versions of them which are available, and which versions of packages are compatible or incompatible with each other. A registry is indexed by package name and UUID, and has a directory for each registered package providing the following metadata about it:</p><ul><li><p>name – e.g. <code>DataFrames</code></p></li><li><p>UUID – e.g. <code>a93c6f00-e57d-5684-b7b6-d8193f3e46c0</code></p></li><li><p>authors – e.g. <code>Jane Q. Developer &lt;jane@example.com&gt;</code></p></li><li><p>license – e.g. MIT, BSD3, or GPLv2</p></li><li><p>repository – e.g. <code>https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl.git</code></p></li><li><p>description – a block of text summarizing the functionality of a package</p></li><li><p>keywords – e.g. <code>data</code>, <code>tabular</code>, <code>analysis</code>, <code>statistics</code></p></li><li><p>versions – a list of all registered version tags</p></li></ul><p>For each registered version of a package, the following information is provided:</p><ul><li><p>its semantic version number – e.g. <code>v1.2.3</code></p></li><li><p>its git tree SHA-1 hash – e.g. <code>7ffb18ea3245ef98e368b02b81e8a86543a11103</code></p></li><li><p>a map from names to UUIDs of dependencies</p></li><li><p>which versions of other packages it is compatible/incompatible with</p></li></ul><p>Dependencies and compatiblity are stored in a compressed but human-readable format using ranges of package verions.</p><p><strong>Depot:</strong> a directory on a system where various package-related resources live, including:</p><ul><li><p><code>environments</code>: shared named environments (e.g. <code>v0.7</code>, <code>devtools</code>)</p></li><li><p><code>clones</code>: bare clones of package repositories</p></li><li><p><code>compiled</code>: cached compiled package images (<code>.ji</code> files)</p></li><li><p><code>config</code>: global configuration files (e.g. <code>startup.jl</code>)</p></li><li><p><code>dev</code>: default directory for package development</p></li><li><p><code>logs</code>: log files (e.g. <code>manifest_usage.toml</code>, <code>repl_history.jl</code>)</p></li><li><p><code>packages</code>: installed package versions</p></li><li><p><code>registries</code>: clones of registries (e.g. <code>Uncurated</code>)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Load path:</strong> a stack of environments where package identities, their dependencies, and entry-points are searched for. The load path is controlled in Julia by the <code>LOAD_PATH</code> global variable which is populated at startup based on the value of the <code>JULIA_LOAD_PATH</code> environment variable. The first entry is your primary environment, often the current project, while later entries provide additional packages one may want to use from the REPL or top-level scripts.</p><p><strong>Depot path:</strong> a stack of depot locations where the package manager, as well as Julia&#39;s code loading mechanisms, look for registries, installed packages, named environments, repo clones, cached compiled package images, and configuration files. The depot path is controlled by the Julia <code>DEPOT_PATH</code> global variable which is populated at startup based on the value of the <code>JULIA_DEPOT_PATH</code> environment variable. The first entry is the “user depot” and should be writable by and owned by the current user. The user depot is where: registries are cloned, new package versions are installed, named environments are created and updated, package repos are cloned, new compiled package image files are saved, log files are written, development packages are checked out by default, and global configuration data is saved. Later entries in the depot path are treated as read-only and are appropriate for registries, packages, etc. installed and managed by system administrators.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Getting-Started-1" href="#Getting-Started-1">Getting Started</a></h2><p>The Pkg REPL-mode is entered using from the Julia REPL using the key <code>]</code>.
